Ponder this ...

• In what ways and in what areas of myself and my life do I buy into a mindset of « otherness » that creates separation, us vs. them, battles for being right ?  
• Can I stop seeing myself as an island and, instead, realise I'm part of the ocean of humanity ?  
• What am I so afraid to let go of that it is, in essence, killing me ?

> Our hearts resonate at the same frequency as the earth and the universe. Therefore, we are all valuable instruments in the orchestration of the world and its harmony. We must always be aware of the vibrations we emit individually and collectively. Always be in command of your music. ~ Suzy Kassem

We must be wiling to let go of outmoded thinking that compartmentalises our lives, ourselves, the world around us.

We must let go of the notion that this thing, this person, this situation, this part over here has nothing to do with this one over there, and never the twain shall meet.

It's the underlying principle behind of the moment memes posted to Facebook such as « I am Paris » or « I am Syria » or « I am \[fill in the blank\] » ... because we know, deep down at our core, that there is nothing that separates us, that differences -- be they of nationality, culture, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, religious belief or practice, politics -- are all constructs of an illusory nature.

It's the commonality of being human and experiencing the human condition, even though the details may be different and unique for each of us.

And it is time that we begin to see and live in a way that understands and operates from a perspective that we're all in this together rather than it's every person for themselves, I got mine so I don't care about you, « they » can't possibly understand what I'm going through / where I come from / my culture or way of life / \[insert whatever you may fall prey to thinking makes you somehow separate, different, superior, inferior, right (and « they » are wrong) or whatever « otherness » you may subscribe to and define yourself by\].

Let go of blaming others or holding on to an outdated self-definition in order to have the courage, willingness, and to give yourself permission to take responsibility for your part not only for how things are, but also for how you can be an active, productive, creative force for how things can be instead of just singing the same old song of « woe is me. »

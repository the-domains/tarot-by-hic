_• What do I need to approach in a radical way ?  
• Can I be the anarchist rather than the one who diligently works to maintain the status quo ?  
• Have I been a follower for long enough (or too long) and need to start doing things my own way ?_

_No one is more qualified than you are to decide how you live; no one should be able to vote on what you do with your time and your potential unless you invite them to._ ~ CrimethInc

You say want a revolution ?

Things are not like they used to be. And they can't go back. And they can't continue on as they are.

We are being urged, compelled, dragged into the chaos and anarchy of knowing things need to change, but unsure or unclear about what the new needs to look like.

All we can be sure of is that the old way, the old order, is corrupt and dying. There is an urgency to overthrowing and dismantling it rather than letting it go on infecting everything else around it, harming all but the select few.

We need to purge, clear and purify ... whether that is our thinking, physical bodies for health, spaces we inhabit to clear the clutter and toss out the old rather than letting it sit and rot (both literally and how it affects the energy of the space as a result), or larger figures, institutions and systems.

We are encouraged to try things in a new way, to not adhere to the old ways, the traditions, but to be radical in our thinking, action and way of being so that we can move toward establishing something new, something more in alignment with who we are and what we need now rather than just « trying to make it work » by trying to find some way of twisting, squeezing, forcing, breaking it into the old.

Instead of falling back on the way things have been done, or how we were taught or raised, or even what might be the norms of our tribe, community, culture, society, let yourself break free and figure out what and how it works best for you.

It's the outsider, the radical, the one who's not afraid to disrupt that will rise up. Will you lead the way or just fall in line and follow behind ?

And ... if we choose to engage this process now, we are likely to see some interesting, positive, rewarding, beneficial results towards the end of the year. But take note, that's as a result of where we place our efforts and energy now, not waiting until then.

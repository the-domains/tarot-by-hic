**Ponder this ...**  
_• What can I do today that would soothe the body and nourish the soul ?_  
_• Can I engage in the process of imagining the future without needing to do or decide anything in particular or definitively ?_  
_• What creative outlet or project is calling to me ?_  
_• When's the last time I just let myself soak in a long, hot bath losing track of time ?_

_Wrapped in the deep fragrance of the forest, I listen to the flapping of the birds' wings, to the stirring of the ferns. I'm freed from gravity and float up--just a little--from the ground and drift in the air. Of course I can't stay there forever. It's just a momentary sensation--open my eyes and it's gone. Still, it's an overwhelming experience. Being able to float in the air._  
~ Haruki Murakami

Today, we float ...

Ease into the day ... see where the day takes you ... wade into the stream of creativity, art, socialising ...

And do it all with friends.

We do need to start turning our attention to things that need to get done in the coming days and weeks. But let's do so gently, letting the imagination and daydream process be the first start, unfettered by too many facts or details versus the exploration of possibility and potential.

Be kind ... be compassionate ...

Treat yourself and others to an indulgence, a luxury, something escapist.

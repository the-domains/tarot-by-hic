**Ponder this ...**  
_• Am I neglecting my own healing needs and process in order to support others in theirs ?_  
_• Where am I overindulging my emotional reactions and reactions against based on assumption and illusion ?_  
_• Am I trying to rush into or through some sort of transformation process ?_

_One moment she didn't know; the next minute she did. One moment her mind was as blank as the desert; the next minute the snake of suspicion had slithered into her thoughts and raised its poisonous head._ ~ Thrity Umrigar

We want to recoil a bit, today, pulling back and inward from overindulging in emotions and actions that aren't based on things that are quite real or right.

Let's not be too quick to shed and let go of things.

On the other hand, if something has been lifeless for a while now, then let's go ahead and allow it to fall away and slowly, gently start trying on our new skin, that which is growing and shifting and evolving to take its place.

There are aspects of healing that need, perhaps unavoidably calling, our attention. It's important to pay attention to what those are and where they are coming from. And to realise that at this point in the healing process, it's up to us to do what we need, what is necessary, rather than looking to or waiting on some outside force or entity to somehow transform or heal things.

Instead of putting too much of our time and energy towards supporting the healing process in others, let's make time, priority and give ourselves permission to hone in on and work through our own healing. By doing so, we can be far more effective in supporting others.

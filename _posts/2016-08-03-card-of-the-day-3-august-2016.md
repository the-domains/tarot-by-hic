## Card of the Day • KING of PENTACLES  
Herbal Ally • ALFALFA

**Ponder this ...**  
_• Am I in charge and in control of how I'm using my resources ?  
• How can I share the wealth ?  
• Am I appreciating all that I have and all that I'm capable of ?  
• Are my thoughts, words and actions all in alignment ?_

_Not what we have but what we enjoy, constitutes our abundance._ ~ Epicurus

Abundance in all things is possible today. This can mean both the good and the bad.

Whatever we put our attention, energy and action towards today we are likely to see flourish and prosper.

Channelling our passion, enthusiasm, drive, creativity can produce amazing results beyond what we might have initially envisioned.

Allowing ourselves to get caught up in negative thinking, petty arguments, defeatist attitudes can snowball and take hold to the point of stopping us dead in our tracks.

It's up to us how we choose to focus and use our thoughts, words, deeds today. Let's do so to the best of our ability and towards the most productive and interesting ends.

This is a great time to reach out to someone who has the means to assist or support you in some way.

Similarly, be generous with your own resources, knowledge and experience. Share it, and you'll likely see a payoff that goes beyond what might have been anticipated.

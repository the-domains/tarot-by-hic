# Card of the Day • 22 July 2016

**Ponder this ...**

* _What brings me comfort that I can surround myself with and indulge in today ?_
* _Can I just focus on what is already known rather than creating unnecessary options, choices, concerns ?_
* _Can I free my mind from worry and relax into just being and going with the flow ?_

_Take a walk outside - it will serve you far more than pacing around in your mind_. ~ Rasheed Ogunlaru

Free your mind !

Today, we give our mind and thoughts the freedom to relax, to chill, to not worry or stress over things.

We turn away from figuring out, philosophising, pondering ... ... and we fall deeply into just being, surrounding ourselves with the people, places and things that make us feel good, that comfort the body, mind, heart and soul.

We know what we need, so instead of creating questions and choices where they don't need to be, let's just move into that which we already know.

Enhance what you already know, what you're already familiar with doing. Instead of experimenting with that new dish, or venturing into that new place, being around those new people, let's focus on what we know and rely on those things that are easy, pleasing, comfortable, where we can be secure in the knowledge of who we are and how we need to interact.

This is a day of freedom from the worries and cares of the outside, every day world. Inward we turn towards that which we call Home.

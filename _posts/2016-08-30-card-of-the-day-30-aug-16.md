**Ponder this ...**  
_• Am I fully participating in the creation and/or re-invention of my own life ?_  
_• What can I celebrate in order to then put behind me to make way for the new ?_  
_• Can I embrace the chaos of totally reorganising and restructuring rather than complacently floating in the status quo ?_

> _Liberty, then, is the sovereignty of the individual, and never shall man know liberty until each & every individual is acknowledged to be the only legitimate sovereign of his or her person, time, & property, each living and acting at his own cost._ ~ Josiah Warren

We are being asked to be a fully present participant in life, and especially in how our own lives are constructed, structured, run and what they are moving towards.

This is the time to step back and, first of all, celebrate and enjoy where you've come from, who has aided you along the way, and what you've accomplished thus far.

But it is also time to recognise where we might be resting on our laurels, slipping into complacency because it's easier to just leave things as they are rather than challenge ourselves to shake things up and go through a period of reorganisation, restructuring, questioning without justifying expected answers.

Be willing to step into different areas of your life and ask, « How can this be done differently ? »

We don't have to come up with answers or solutions overnight. More importantly is the process of being the anarchist, the one who is willing to come in to shake, rattle and roll things around. Recognise the potency of the power behind chaos, not just giving in to the easiness of the status quo.

But not just to then walk away. Instead, commit to the stamina and perseverance that it will take to move through the disarray in order for something new to emerge, for a differently structured and organised approach to things to take shape and start to take hold.

Engage with others without losing yourself and your vision in the process.

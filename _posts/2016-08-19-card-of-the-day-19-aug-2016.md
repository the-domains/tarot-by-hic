**Ponder this ...**  
_• What needs to get started, to get done, that establishes a solid base for growing and building on ?  
• Am I committed to the work and the patience to see it through (and, if not, can I accept this might not be the right thing at the right time) ?  
• How can I make sure that everything is in place for the long term reward rather than the short term payoff ?_

_I am told by people all the time that they simply do not have time to read and listen to all the material they have purchased or subscribed to. But time is democratic and just. Everyone has the same amount. When I choose to read with my mid morning coffee break and you choose to blather about trivia with friends, when I choose to study for an hour sitting on my backyard deck at day's end but you choose to watch a TIVO'd American Idol episode, we reveal much. When someone says he does not have the time to apply himself to acquiring the know-how required to create sufficient value for his stated desires, he is a farmer surrounded by ripe fruit and vegetables, whole grains, and a herd of cattle on his own property who dies of starvation, unable to organize his time and discipline himself to eat._ ~ Dan S. Kennedy

We need something to lean on, something to hold on to, something that can give form, substance, stability to our thoughts and emotions.

It's time to get started, to actually begin doing what we've been considering, planning, feeling called to do.

Let today be the day that you look back and mark as the anniversary of when you took the first real, tangible, for all the world to see step towards creating what you want your future to look like.

We've reached the point of no looking back, of no more putting off. But also the point where we realise we can't go back to doing things the way they've always been done, holding on to situations and processes in their old form.

New structures, new organisation, new containers, new foundations, new processes.

The details are important ... and, in a sense, never more so than now. Because the details we make sure to get right at this moment are going to determine the vitality, viability and sustainability of everything else that is to come.

Plant wisely ... fertilise appropriately ... commit to the cultivation, work, resources necessary for the long haul.

And this time next year (it's about the patience to get it right rather than the speed to just get it done), marvel at what you've accomplished, where you've arrived, what you've been able to do in that span of time.

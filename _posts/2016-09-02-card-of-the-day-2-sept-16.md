**Ponder this ...**  
_• Am I drowning out the messages from the Universe ?  
• How can I sit with hope for the future rather than rushing into action for instant gratification of expectation ?  
• How can I heal what has created hopelessness to fill that space with hope and possibility once again ?_

_Go placidly amid the noise and haste, and remember what peace there may be in silence._ ~ Max Ehrmann

... shhhhh ...  
... calm the mind, calm the body, calm the spirit ...  
... shhhhh ...

Visions of what we want to do and where we want to go are dancing in our heads. Ideas shoot, pop and crackle with possibility, excitement, compulsion to get them done, make them happen.

But there is also an air of confusion, illusion and fantasy that permeates which can create unrealistic timetables, over exaggerated capabilities, and complications down the road due to not taking the time to pause and think things through before rushing ahead in to action.

Let's take some time to sit with the visions, to wade into the dreams of the future, to float ideas simply to observe how they ripple outward without needing to dive in to immediate (premature) action.

Look for signs that can help to plot the course, indicate the path, reveal the direction. And be open to that not necessarily being what is expected, or even wanted. But stay open to trusting that it's being show in that way for a reason, and sink into trusting that in order to have a bearing by which we can begin to map out the journey.

Hope where there was frustration or hopelessness is starting to gently bubble up to the surface. We can feel positive and optimistic again about what could be rather than forlorn about what hasn't been.

Silence is golden ... in order for us to be as aware and receptive as possible to what is being revealed. Let's relax out of our own way.

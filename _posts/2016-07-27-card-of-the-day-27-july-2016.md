**Ponder this ...**

_• What ideas or insights can I take real world action on today ?  
• Am I getting distracted or offtrack ?_

_A person who is gifted sees the essential point and leaves the rest as surplus._  
~ Thomas Carlyle

It's time to take new insights and ideas to the next level.

Be prepared today as our minds are executing at maximum capacity. As long as we can keep what's coming up focused and controlled, then we can accomplish some amazing things (or at least get them initiated).

We want to translate thoughts, ideas, insights, plans, inventions into real world steps and actions. It's time to go beyond just the thinking about phase, and into having something to show for it at the end of the day that signals real progress or a real start having been made.

Ideas are maturing, so it may be more of an emphasis on things that have already been percolating rather than brand new ideas. But there could also be new ideas, insights, approaches that come up to help move something forward that has been stalled or confusing.

Keep conversations to the point. Be quick, clean and efficient. There isn't time for mellifluousness today. Simplicity will further. Distractions can be deadly to what we can accomplish today.

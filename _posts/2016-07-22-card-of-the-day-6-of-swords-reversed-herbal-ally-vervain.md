# Card of the Day • 22 July 2016

## Card of the Day • 6 of SWORDS Reversed  
Herbal Ally • VERVAIN

**Ponder this ...**  
_• What have I been burdened by for too long that it's time to toss overboard in order to lighten the load and move on ?  
• How are my familiar excuses and justifications preventing me from moving forward, growing, changing, evolving ?  
• How can I remain conscious of the fact that I'm not the only on suffering ?_

_There is nothing noble about suffering except the love and forgiveness with which we meet it._  
~ Stephen Levine

There's an old song that goes, « Nobody knows the troubles I've seen. »

But it's time for us to stop being defined by the troubles, challenges, hurts, mistakes that are in the past. We can hold on to them almost like a security blanket, preferring to stay comfortably ensconced in a familiar self-identity rather than challenge ourselves to reinvent ourselves, to rediscover who we are now (rather than who we are through the lens of who we were), to release the burdens rather than see it as a badge of honour, courage, noble suffering for bearing the weight of them.

Pay attention to what seems to be the default excuse, the fall back justification, the blaming of the past for how something is in the present (or why we think/say we can't/won't have or be something in the future).

These are the things and the areas that it is time to do some work around, to release, let go, and move on from rather than continue to endlessly float in.

One thing we can take advantage of today is the Moon in Pisces, which allows us to see reflected back to us ourselves in others. Those things that trigger us, or that make us feel sorry for, or repel us in others ... this is where we need to look in ourselves.

It also means that we are able to be reminded that we're not in this alone, and we're not the only ones who have experienced or suffered. Allow a heightened empathy to let us feel a part of something bigger, that we're not an island of isolated experience, that others can understand and will support us.

Share the burden and watch it dissipate and evaporate.

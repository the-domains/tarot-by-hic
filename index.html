no one should be able to vote on what you do with your time and your potential unless you invite them to.</em> ~ CrimethInc</p><p>You say want a revolution ?</p><p>Things are not like they used to be. And they can’t go back. And they can't continue on as they are.</p><p>We are being urged, compelled, dragged into the chaos and anarchy of knowing things need to change, but unsure or unclear about what the new needs to look like.</p><p>All we can be sure of is that the old way, the old order, is corrupt and dying. There is an urgency to overthrowing and dismantling it rather than letting it go on infecting everything else around it, harming all but the select few.</p><p>We need to purge, clear and purify … whether that is our thinking, physical bodies for health, spaces we inhabit to clear the clutter and toss out the old rather than letting it sit and rot (both literally and how it affects the energy of the space as a result), or larger figures, institutions and systems.</p><p>We are encouraged to try things in a new way, to not adhere to the old ways, the traditions, but to be radical in our thinking, action and way of being so that we can move toward establishing something new, something more in alignment with who we are and what we need now rather than just « trying to make it work » by trying to find some way of twisting, squeezing, forcing, breaking it into the old.</p><p>Instead of falling back on the way things have been done, or how we were taught or raised, or even what might be the norms of our tribe, community, culture, society, let yourself break free and figure out what and how it works best for you.</p><p>It’s the outsider, the radical, the one who’s not afraid to disrupt that will rise up. Will you lead the way or just fall in line and follow behind ?</p><p>And … if we choose to engage this process now, we are likely to see some interesting, positive, rewarding, beneficial results towards the end of the year. But take note, that’s as a result of where we place our efforts and energy now, not waiting until then.</p><p>Image : Light Grey Tarot</p><p>#tarot #card #reading #tarotscopes #cardoftheday

<h1>Card of the Day •&nbsp;19 Aug 2016</h1><p><strong>Card of the Day • ACE of PENTACLES<br>Herbal Ally • WHOLE GRAINS</strong></p><p>Subscribe : <a href="http://bit.ly/1OgxinP" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bit.ly/1OgxinP</a><br><a href="http://www.tarotbyhic.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tarotbyhic.net</a></p><p><strong>Ponder this ...</strong><br><em>• What needs to get started, to get done, that establishes a solid base for growing and building on ?<br>• Am I committed to the work and the patience to see it through (and, if not, can I accept this might not be the right thing at the right time) ?<br>• How can I make sure that everything is in place for the long term reward rather than the short term payoff ?</em></p><p><em>I am told by people all the time that they simply do not have time to read and listen to all the material they have purchased or subscribed to. But time is democratic and just. Everyone has the same amount. When I choose to read with my mid morning coffee break and you choose to blather about trivia with friends, when I choose to study for an hour sitting on my backyard deck at day's end but you choose to watch a TIVO'd American Idol episode, we reveal much. When someone says he does not have the time to apply himself to acquiring the know-how required to create sufficient value for his stated desires, he is a farmer surrounded by ripe fruit and vegetables, whole grains, and a herd of cattle on his own property who dies of starvation, unable to organize his time and discipline himself to eat.</em> ~ Dan S. Kennedy</p><p>We need something to lean on, something to hold on to, something that can give form, substance, stability to our thoughts and emotions.</p><p>It’s time to get started, to actually begin doing what we’ve been considering, planning, feeling called to do.</p><p>Let today be the day that you look back and mark as the anniversary of when you took the first real, tangible, for all the world to see step towards creating what you want your future to look like.</p><p>We’ve reached the point of no looking back, of no more putting off. But also the point where we realise we can’t go back to doing things the way they’ve always been done, holding on to situations and processes in their old form.</p><p>New structures, new organisation, new containers, new foundations, new processes.</p><p>The details are important … and, in a sense, never more so than now. Because the details we make sure to get right at this moment are going to determine the vitality, viability and sustainability of everything else that is to come.</p><p>Plant wisely … fertilise appropriately … commit to the cultivation, work, resources necessary for the long haul.</p><p>And this time next year (it's about the patience to get it right rather than the speed to just get it done), marvel at what you’ve accomplished, where you’ve arrived, what you’ve been able to do in that span of time.</p><p>Image : The Mythic Tarot</p><p>Subscribe to the Card of the Day newsletter featuring astrological information and timing for the day, expanded information on the herbal ally, longterm astrological information and, of course, the Card of the Day.

I'm freed from gravity and float up--just a little--from the ground and drift in the air. Of course I can't stay there forever. It's just a momentary sensation--open my eyes and it's gone. Still, it's an overwhelming experience. Being able to float in the air.</em><br>~ Haruki Murakami</p><p>Today, we float …</p><p>Ease into the day … see where the day takes you … wade into the stream of creativity, art, socialising …</p><p>And do it all with friends.</p><p>We do need to start turning our attention to things that need to get done in the coming days and weeks. But let’s do so gently, letting the imagination and daydream process be the first start, unfettered by too many facts or details versus the exploration of possibility and potential.</p><p>Be kind … be compassionate …</p><p>Treat yourself and others to an indulgence, a luxury, something escapist.</p><p>Image : Petrak Tarot</p><p>Subscribe to the Card of the Day newsletter featuring astrological information and timing for the day, expanded information on the herbal ally, longterm astrological information and, of course, the Card of the Day.

It’s important to pay attention to what those are and where they are coming from. And to realise that at this point in the healing process, it’s up to us to do what we need, what is necessary, rather than looking to or waiting on some outside force or entity to somehow transform or heal things.</p><p>Instead of putting too much of our time and energy towards supporting the healing process in others, let’s make time, priority and give ourselves permission to hone in on and work through our own healing. By doing so, we can be far more effective in supporting others.</p><p>Image : Power Animal Oracle</p><p>Subscribe to the Card of the Day newsletter featuring astrological information and timing for the day, expanded information on the herbal ally, longterm astrological information and, of course, the Card of the Day.

<h2>Card of the Day • PAGE of SWORDS Reversed<br>Herbal Ally • DILL</h2><p><strong>Ponder this ...</strong></p><p><em>• What ideas or insights can I take real world action on today ?<br>• Am I getting distracted or offtrack ?</em></p><p><em>A person who is gifted sees the essential point and leaves the rest as surplus.</em><br>~ Thomas Carlyle</p><p>It’s time to take new insights and ideas to the next level.</p><p>Be prepared today as our minds are executing at maximum capacity. As long as we can keep what’s coming up focused and controlled, then we can accomplish some amazing things (or at least get them initiated).</p><p>We want to translate thoughts, ideas, insights, plans, inventions into real world steps and actions. It’s time to go beyond just the thinking about phase, and into having something to show for it at the end of the day that signals real progress or a real start having been made.</p><p>Ideas are maturing, so it may be more of an emphasis on things that have already been percolating rather than brand new ideas. But there could also be new ideas, insights, approaches that come up to help move something forward that has been stalled or confusing.</p><p>Keep conversations to the point. Be quick, clean and efficient. There isn’t time for mellifluousness today. Simplicity will further. Distractions can be deadly to what we can accomplish today.</p><p>Image : Animals Divine Tarot</p><p>Subscribe to the Card of the Day newsletter featuring astrological information and timing for the day, expanded information on the herbal ally, longterm astrological information and, of course, the Card of the Day.

We can hold on to them almost like a security blanket, preferring to stay comfortably ensconced in a familiar self-identity rather than challenge ourselves to reinvent ourselves, to rediscover who we are now (rather than who we are through the lens of who we were), to release the burdens rather than see it as a badge of honour, courage, noble suffering for bearing the weight of them.</p><p>Pay attention to what seems to be the default excuse, the fall back justification, the blaming of the past for how something is in the present (or why we think/say we can’t/won’t have or be something in the future).</p><p>These are the things and the areas that it is time to do some work around, to release, let go, and move on from rather than continue to endlessly float in.</p><p>One thing we can take advantage of today is the Moon in Pisces, which allows us to see reflected back to us ourselves in others. Those things that trigger us, or that make us feel sorry for, or repel us in others … this is where we need to look in ourselves.</p><p>It also means that we are able to be reminded that we’re not in this alone, and we’re not the only ones who have experienced or suffered. Allow a heightened empathy to let us feel a part of something bigger, that we’re not an island of isolated experience, that others can understand and will support us.</p><p>Share the burden and watch it dissipate and evaporate.</p><p>Image : Markéta Gebrian</p><p>Subscribe to the Card of the Day newsletter featuring astrological information and timing for the day, expanded information on the herbal ally, longterm astrological information and, of course, the Card of the Day.
